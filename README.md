# GNOME Extensions Backup Script

A simple Bash script to **export and import your GNOME Shell extensions configuration** using `dconf`.

I created this after searching for a while for a clean way to back up my GNOME extensions setup. This script makes it easy to save your current config and restore it later, which is especially useful when reinstalling your system or syncing settings across multiple machines.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PomeZzz/GNOME-Extensions-Backup-Script
cd File location
```
### 2. Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### 3. Export your current extensions config
